# Saman Zargarzadeh
I'm a creative engineer in the business world, with a multidisciplinary background in aerospace engineering and an MS in Business Analytics. Skilled in data analysis and visualization, I have a passion for using data to drive business decisions and insights. What sets me apart is my ability to think outside the box, bringing a fresh perspective to business problems. I am seeking an analyst role for a summer internship or fall full-time job where I can leverage my skills to make strategic, data-driven decisions.
